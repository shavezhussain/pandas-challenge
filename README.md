# School District Analysis

This Python script performs a comprehensive analysis of school district data. The analysis includes calculations and data visualization for various metrics related to student performance, school budget, and school size. The data used for this analysis is provided in CSV files and represents the entire school district.

## Overview

The analysis is structured into several sections, each addressing specific aspects of the school district data:

### 1. District Summary

This section provides an overview of the entire school district. It calculates key district-level metrics, such as the total number of schools, total number of students, total budget, average math and reading scores, and the percentage of students passing math and reading.

### 2. School Summary

In this section, individual school performance within the district is analyzed. Key metrics are calculated for each school, including average math and reading scores, the percentage of students passing math and reading, and the overall passing rate.

### 3. Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)

This part of the analysis identifies and ranks the top-performing schools in the district based on their overall passing rate.

### 4. Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)

Conversely, this section identifies and ranks the bottom-performing schools in the district based on their overall passing rate.

### 5. Math and Reading Scores by Grade

This section breaks down the average math and reading scores by grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th) for each school in the entire district.

### 6. Scores by School Spending

Here, the district's schools are grouped by spending per student, and averages for math and reading scores, as well as the percentage of students passing math and reading, are calculated for different spending ranges.

### 7. Scores by School Size

This section categorizes schools by size (small, medium, or large) within the district and calculates average scores and passing percentages based on school size.

### 8. Scores by School Type

Lastly, the analysis categorizes schools by type (charter or district) within the district and calculates average scores and passing percentages based on school type.

## Instructions

To run this comprehensive analysis:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Install the necessary Python libraries if you haven't already. You can use pip to install them:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```

3. Download the CSV files containing the school and student data.

4. Modify the script as needed to specify the file paths for the CSV files.

5. Execute the Python script, and it will generate the comprehensive analysis results and visualizations for the entire school district.

## Analysis

The analysis results are presented in tables and visualizations, offering valuable insights into school district performance, factors influencing student outcomes, and comparisons between schools of different sizes and types, all within the context of the entire school district.

## Data Sources

- School data is provided in a CSV file (`Resources/schools_complete.csv`).
- Student data is provided in a CSV file (`Resources/students_complete.csv`).

Ensure that these data files are in the same directory as the script, or provide the appropriate file paths in the script.

For further details about the analysis and the code, refer to the comments and explanations within the script.
